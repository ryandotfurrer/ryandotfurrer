# 👋 I'm Ryan Furrer, and I'm a UX Engineer

I am a UX Engineer looking for my first role in tech as I am transitioning careers from a Buyer in Procurement/Supply Chain. Proficient in React, NextJS, Astro, and TailwindCSS, I bring transferable skills in project management, problem-solving, and more.

I am currently building in public on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ryandotfurrer) and [X](https://twitter.com/ryandotfurrer); I also have a [blog](http://ryanfurrer.com/blog) and [newsletter](https://ryanfurrer.beehiiv.com/?_gl=1*8atz45*_ga*MjA3OTk1MTA5Ni4xNzA2MjQxMjI5*_ga_E6Y4WLQ2EC*MTcwODE4MzA2My4xNS4wLjE3MDgxODMwNjMuNjAuMC43ODE4NjQ5ODA.*_gcl_au*NjMwODcwMzUyLjE3MDYyNDEyMjg.).
