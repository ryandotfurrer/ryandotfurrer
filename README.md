# 👋 I'm Ryan Furrer, and I'm a Frontend Web Developer

Detail-oriented Frontend Web Developer who creates and implements a website's visual and interactive elements using technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NextJS, and CSS including SASS, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS. I bring the user interface to life, ensuring it is visually appealing, functional, and user-friendly. Additionally, I test, debug, and improve the website's performance, usability, and accessibility.
