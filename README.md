# 👋 I'm Ryan Furrer, and I'm a Frontend Engineer

Detail-oriented Frontend Engineer who specializes in designing, creating, and implementing user-friendly and accessible UI/UX using technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and more. I bring the user interface to life, ensuring it is visually appealing, functional, and user-friendly. Additionally, I test, debug, and improve the website's performance, usability, and accessibility.
